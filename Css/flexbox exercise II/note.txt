I Finished this task in 1hr 
The difficulties I faced is only using display:flex, justify-content and align-items to move and align the boxes. 
Its just trial and error for me trying different things using that tags to see what the outcome will be and how the content in html react.
Im getting the hang of using this to align the content in my html rather than depending on margin and padding only.
