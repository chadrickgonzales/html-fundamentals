Aligning multiple content in a section can become a time consuming task like in the nav bar aligning the logo with
 the nav buttons to the search bar it takes time to finally align it to the way i wanted it to look like. 
 Aligning in css still gives me a hard time in development but im still adjusting to it.
 It took me an hour and a half to finish it.
