Styling with CSS took me an hour to finish. I am still familiarizing myself with the syntax again since I haven't used this language for almost two years,
so I am still adjusting to the tags I am using.

Challenges that i have faced in this assignment is relearning the syntax again like the display and align-items how it works. 

My favorite style that i have done in this assignment is the form the contact section. 
I have spend a lot of my time in that part deciding what style i want to go with and how i will implement it.
